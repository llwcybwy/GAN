We then do the same for Monet and let the total loss be the average of the two losses. Finally, we update the weights based on the losses.

Since the discriminant is improved in the previous iteration, we thus want to generate data and change the weights in the generator such that the discrimant believes it to be true, hence why we take the mse of the fake data wrt 1. Note that by \"moving away\" from the discriminator, we do not train a generator which can create images that the discriminator is tailored to recognize and converge pretty quickly, but we instead capitalize from our improved discriminator and use it to iteratively improve towards data which more closely resembles the target distribution.\n",
    "2. __Cycle__: An image is converted to the other distribution, and then back again to the first distribution. It is then compared with the original image using the $L^1$ norm. By doing this, we hope to train the CycleGAN to only make necessary changes to images, and for the two used generators to identify the same features to change.\n",
