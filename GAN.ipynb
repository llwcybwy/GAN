Note that by \"moving away\" from the discriminator, we do not train a generator which can create images that the discriminator is tailored to recognize and converge pretty quickly, but we instead capitalize from our improved discriminator and use it to iteratively improve towards data which more closely resembles the target distribution.\n",

By doing this, we hope to train the CycleGAN to only make necessary changes to images, and for the two used generators to identify the same features to change.\n",
